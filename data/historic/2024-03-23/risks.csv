Investment policy and performance
The Charity has established an investment policy with Mercer Investment Advisors (formerly Pavillion) that provides for a diversified portfolio with a primary objective of balancing long-term real investment returns and capital preservation. Selection of specific investment vehicles is done with the support of our investment advisors. We have operated an informal policy of paying out an absolute maximum of 60% of our investment income through any given year. This has stood us in good stead as investment markets have been buffeted both by Covid and the war in Ukraine.

The principal risks facing Old Mill Topco are as follows:

1 Economic risks, and in particular, the ongoing risk of rising interest rates and inflation. More recently, these
macro risks have been compounded by the increase in conflicts around the world, notably in Europe and the
Middle East. To help manage these risks, multi-year financial forecasts have been produced, with different
scenarios run for different levels of interest rates. We also maintain a strong balance sheet which gives us a

Our industry has faced significant challenges during the year to March 2023, including inflation and the availability of materials.  Headline inflation increased significantly and erratically following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the subsequent pressure on the energy markets, resulted in construction sector inflation outstripping general inflation.

We also had added pressures of local competition in our sector de-stabilising the market, and, despite these issues, we are pleased to have managed to overcome any such difficulties and continue our upward trajectory.  This has been achieved through the hard work, dedication and resilience of our loyal workforce.

Review of the business
During the year to March 2023, the directors pursued a policy to maximize promotion of the hospitality assets, in line with their destination management strategy for the brand, Petworth Places.
 Challenges for the year to March 2023
 Recruiting the skills we require in the hospitality business has proved to be an ongoing challenge and Brexit has seen a reduction in the number of qualified chefs and senior service staff from Europe, who have repatriated. With our business being located outside of a major conurbation, limited transport links and affordable accommodation for hospitality staff is also an issue that we have tried to mitigate by renting out staff flats to key workers.

Plant and Bean Ltd

The business did not recover from the rise in raw material & energy prices, only to be further impacted by higher interest rates & a slow down in demand due to the cost of living crisis. Due to these pressures & the delays in receiving agreed funding, the directors decided to call in administrators on 31 May 2023. The company has subsequently ceased trading & is in the process of being wound up. The results for Plant and Bean Ltd are included within these accounts as prepared on a basis other than that of a going concern.
