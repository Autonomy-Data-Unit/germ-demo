There is no doubt that the UK’s relentless and exponential increase in population, combined with increased areas of flood land, bode well for Kabina’s system, although it is taking a long time to get spades in the ground.

Review of the business
The major impact on the business in 2022/23 was the flat level of trading in the Company’s markets in the UK and western Europe.
 Turnover for the year was £20.9m (2022: £25.0m); gross profit was £5.6m (2022: £7.3m); operating profit was £0.9m (2022: £2.6m).
 The company continues to make significant investment in product development and in plant and equipment.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The major risks facing the business are external factors such as exchange rates, low rates of economic growth, high level of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine.
