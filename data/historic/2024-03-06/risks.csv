In formulating its plans for 2023. the company made an assessment of strategic risks and threats to business continuity. Two factors that emerged from this assessment were:
1. Increased challenges for Russian-owned businesses trading in Western markets.
2. Reluctance of banking and insurance service providers to offer those services to Russian-owned businesses.
In reality, these strategic risks all materialised to some extent during 2023 as a result of the ongoing geopolitical situation and the more general deterioration in relationships between Russia and many other countries.
