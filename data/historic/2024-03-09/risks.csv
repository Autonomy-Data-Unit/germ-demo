The principal risks facing the Group mirror most of the businesses in the same sector and the economy as a whole. Inflation and interest rate increases have proved difficult to navigate in hospitality as domestic disposable income reduced significantly. Visitor numbers have been extremely pleasing given the economic downturn and maintaining these are paramount.

With inflation and interest hikes also affecting others in the supply chain, as well as global difficulties such as war and reductions in supply, it is important to monitor prices and availability of staffing and goods. Any purchasing and staffing policy has to be adapted in real time to ensure any adverse consequences are kept ot a minimum.

Firstly, supply chain challenges, with lead time on spare parts across local and regional suppliers. Secondly, it was a challenging environment for the recruitment and retention of skilled labour with pressures relating to the cost of living which has pushed up wage demands.
 Overall
 A very strong performance in the Customer Support sector has driven the increased financial performance of the company in 2023. The Logistics sector has showed a steady performance with the delivery of the active projects and the Airport sector has improved with the early contract on the re-commencement of the baggage delivery project.
 Administrative costs have increased on previous years with the company moving to a new head office in the Midlands, higher recruitment and relocation costs for key personnel and an increased headcount overall.

  Principal risks and uncertainties
 
Given the nature of the company's business, the principal business risks relate to the following:
• Supply chain 
• Energy price astronomical increase
• Uncertain geopolitical situation
• Qualified staff shortage
• Recession/Cost of living
• Inflation across the board.
Various factors above are linked to the wider Economy, the majority of impact is being felt at present, and  all indications are that it is not necessarily beneficial to the sector. For example , Inflation, Energy prices, supply  chain  ,  recruitment  and  retention  of  workers  and  the  influence  of  uncertainty  are decreasing
