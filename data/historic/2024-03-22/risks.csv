CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The group is under enquiry by HM Revenue and Customs in respect of the operation of landfill tax in relation to a site where it provided remediation services for a landowner of an old landfill site. HM Revenue and Customs are contending that, without holding a permit from the Environment Agency, the group's operations related to the disposal of waste on which landfill tax has not been paid and it has raised assessments totalling Â£573,874 which the group has appealed. The group maintains that it was providing a service to the landowner to remedy the defective landfill capping and has used British Standard Certified materials to cap the affected areas.
