Despite the successes of 2023 and prior years, we are currently navigating challenging economic conditions, primarily influenced by ongoing events in Ukraine and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, contributing to heightened market uncertainty.

 Consequently, the company diligently monitors the evolving impact of these events on the business. While the broader economic implications of the situation in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, such as heightened energy prices, increased inflationary pressures, supply issues, and currency fluctuations, are acknowledged, it is important to note that there are no direct financial consequences for the business at this present time.
