The Board of Trustees has a risk management strategy which involves ongoing reviews of risks which the charity might face. The major risks to which the charity might be exposed have been identified and steps taken to mitigate those risks. Such risks include the effect of extreme weather conditions on gate money or the possible effects of eventualities such as cancellation due to Covid-19, foot and mouth and other causes.

A key element in the management of financial risk is the setting up of a reserves policy and its regular review by the Board of Trustees.

BUSINESS REVIEW
  The principal activities of Fulton Boiler Works (Great Britain) Limited during the year were the design, manufacture, marketing, sales, hire, installation and servicing of boilers in the industrial and commercial sectors.

As a business we are clearly seeing signs of companies that massively contribute to the global output of GHGs (Green house gasses) taking net zero very seriously. This can be seen by an increase in our sales of Electric boilers and highly efficient VSRTs. Companies are also interested in our new Hybrid boilers. COP 28 (December 2023) concluded with the World committing to a transition away from fossil fuels.",1431645.0,39,23560,Increasing demand for electricity and energy-efficient boilers due to GHG emission reduction efforts,Climate Change,,,True,[],Increasing demand for electricity and energy-efficient boilers due to GHG emission reduction efforts,BS5 7FG,Bristol,South West,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00855790/filing-history/MzQxNTk3MjExNmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-25
ALBA TREES LIMITED,2188633,['02100'],"Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing",2189,3150,['Silviculture and other forestry activities'],Prod223_3662_02188633_20230831,"Alba Trees is the UK’s largest producer of cell-grown trees for forestry. Cell-grown trees are a premium product with a longer and more versatile planting season. In the UK there is a gradual migration to planting cell-grown trees from the traditional field-grown bare root trees, which Alba expects to continue. Long term, this provides an opportunity for Alba to increase market share.
After another year of global record temperatures and the continued high profile of the ‘climate emergency’, the drive to increase tree planting in the UK continues. New woodland creation, which represents the larger share of Alba’s activity, is driven by grant funding and increasingly the development of natural capital markets. Under UK net zero commitments, there is a target to create 30,000 Ha of new woodland planting, with Scotland’s share assumed to be 18,000 Ha per year. Alba therefore assesses the long-term woodland creation market to be positive and in growth.",8909677.0,131,47990,Exposure to variability of grant funding and development of natural capital markets due to push for increased tree planting,Climate Change,,,True,[],No countries were mentioned explicitly in the risk description.,SW1X 9DQ,London,London,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02188633/filing-history/MzQxNTk4MjMyMmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-25
