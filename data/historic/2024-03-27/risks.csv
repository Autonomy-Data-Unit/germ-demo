BUSINESS REVIEW
2022 was another challenging year for business, beginning with the war in Ukraine and its significant implications for the global economy. The war spurred an unprecedented increase in energy prices and restricted the supply of key raw materials. This created huge inflationary pressure with inflation reaching 11.1% in October 2022; its highest rate in 40 years. The Bank of England reacted by increasing interest rates, up from 0.75% in March 2022 to 4.25% in March 2023. The negative financial consequences of these combined increases cannot be overstated, with many businesses, particularly those with energy intensive operations, simply becoming unviable.",11999727.0,0,72983,Ukraine war,Interstate Conflict,significant implications for the global economy; increased energy prices; restricted supply of key raw materials; inflationary pressure; increased interest rates; negative financial consequences for the company; possible viability issues for energy-intensive operations,,True,['Ukraine'],"The war in Ukraine has been identified as a significant risk source.

Review of the business
With the pandemic reaching its peak in Europe in the beginning of 2022, we still were facing different challenges in normalizing our sales operations and supply chain.
 Two of the largest international trade fairs in Munich and Milan, were postponed to unfavorable dates, months later in the opening season. The logistic challenges for both production and shipping, also caused a delayed kick-off of the 2022 season. This was recovered later in the year, by business development in different territories and various channels.
 The outbreak of the war in Ukraine, had a negative impact on the consumer confidence, resulting in heightened uncertainty and caution among our clients.

The war between Russia and Ukraine had made countries like the US looking to reduce their dependence on Russia, which contribute to more supply backdrop. Against that supply backdrop, uranium demand continued to grow this past year and is set to increase substantially moving forward.

The trend where uranium prices could continue in 2024 remains uncertain, the question is whether the commodity will continue to rise steadily or spike higher like it did in the last cycle. The uncertainty of Fed's policy on interest rate also makes the price forecast more difficult.

During the period under review the company focused on risk management and cautious operation, building its customer base by entering contracts for the purchase and sale of uranium.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the business and the execution of the company's strategy are subject to various risks. The key business risks and uncertainties affecting the company are considered to be:
 Funding
Following Brexit, EMEC's opportunity to participate in EU funded projects has been curtailed. The loss of this revenue has presented a significant risk to EMEC's operations. EMEC is seeking to build up other government funded activities to replace lost revenue from Brexit and has also taken action to reduce costs.
 Revenue support for wave and tidal technology developers

We're good at communicating too, constantly in touch with our customers on one side, and our suppliers on the other to make sure we deliver great quality produce on time and at the best possible price.

The carbon dioxide (and equivalent gases) emitted by the generation of electricity from the UK grid was 44,941 kg CO2e (2022 - 52,318 kg CO2e).
The chosen intensity measurement ratio is total gross emissions in kilograms CO2e per sales revenue, the recommended ratio for the sector. The ratio is 0.00202:1 (2022 - 0.00235:1).
To increase the group’s energy efficiency, management have changed suppliers for the main Head Office to one which only uses renewable energy.

The directors present their strategic report of the company and the group for the year ended 31 March 2023.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS
During this year Makefast made some significant investments on both new equipment and upgrading our premises. In August we commissioned our new Fibre Laser machine, in September we added an new linisher, both of these machines improve our production capabilities. In November Solar panels were fitted to Unit 31 which reduces our energy bills and is a significant move towards net zero.",5122088.0,118,71113,Solar panels implemented,Climate Change,Significant move towards net zero,,True,[],No explicit climate change risks mentioned.,SY16 4LE,Powys,Wales,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/01165517/filing-history/MzQxNjEyNDMyMmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-26

Despite the fact that our organisation offering general management consultancy services, we are always consider the environmental sustainability. Future business performance will be impacted by our ability to effectively manage the transition to a low carbon economy balancing commercial decisions with the environmental responsibility, agreeing business-wide decarbonisation priorities and managing changes in customer preferences.
This include management of the increasing costs associated with sustainable materials, recycling carbon pricing and further technological, policy and regulatory interventions.
We are operating in a world and a sector with high pressure from carbon-conscious customers, government bodies and regulators to operate in a more environmentally conscious manner.
