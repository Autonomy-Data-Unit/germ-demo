The company's focus was on high quality earnings and to drive geographic expansion into new markets and customers, through continued focus on own label and strategic products, which helped to increase turnover to £128.2m (FY 2021: £111.2m). Higher than normal freight charges, aligned to global trends, continued to impact the business in early 2022, although by the end of the year Freight had decreased to normal levels. 2022 also saw sharp increase in Global Interest rates, which significantly increased the Interest cost to the business to £2.1m.

EBITDA for the Financial year improved significantly to £5.4m, after the exceptional balance sheet write offs across 2021, and cash generated from operations was strong at £6.4m.
