Principle risks and uncertainties

The fallout from Covid and the effect of the Ukrainian war increased our lead times and raw material costs.

The increase in the cost of living has been a challenge.

However, the mitigating factors are the investments we made in our machinery, sustainability and staff with training.

Future developments

In the next twelve months, the company is expecting to grow its sales to £8.5m and diversify our brands portfolio and product offering.

In the longer term, the company plans to double its turnover in 3 years.
