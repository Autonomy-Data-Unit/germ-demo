In turn, the group has always maintained prudence and risk aversion in terms of borrowing so low Loan to Value (""LTV"") have always been maintained. This, coupled with shift away in 2014 in relying on fossil fuels as it’s primary energy source, means that, although the group has experienced significant increases in costs – the group is as well placed as any other to cope, and absorb, such increasing cost pressures.

Furthermore, in February 2024, the Directors have taken corrective action through a reduction to working hours across all areas of the business, in order to offset some of the near 10% rise in National Living Wage in April. This will save c.£0.5m on an annualised basis.

We monitor the Bank of England base rate closely and hedge debt as appropriate, in order to balance the twin objectives of minimising exposure to market volatility and also minimising overall interest cost. We currently have a mix of hedged and unhedged debt.

We closely monitor foreign currency fluctuations and manage risk accordingly, albeit foreign currency purchases are not material to the business.
