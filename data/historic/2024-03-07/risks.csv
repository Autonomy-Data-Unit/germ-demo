The house building sector showed continued strength in this trading year, although political and economic factors suggest this will definitely impact the forthcoming year.

The company's financial risk management objectives and policies are detailed in the Directors' Report.

We continue to work closely with our customers and subcontractors to mitigate any negative impacts and consequently, there has been minimal disruption in delivery and supply chains.
