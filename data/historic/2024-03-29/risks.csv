PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties for the company are related to activity levels in the UK construction sector, the continued uptake of modular and offsite construction, and the availability of labour and materials.

Market Risks
In advance of Brexit the company carried out a comprehensive review of its supply chain to understand and mitigate the potential risks that may occur in the period immediately following the UK exit from the EU.

The surge in demand for hyper-efficient, lean, data centres continued to offer lucrative new business opportunities, as well as the growing need to ensure process facilities in the life science sector are fit for purpose.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the group are:

- The risks associated with buying and selling products in foreign currencies - the group maintains foreign currency bank accounts to meet future commitments where appropriate;
- The risk of political turmoil or governmental sanctions - the group actively monitors the status of the nationality of trading partners against UK Government guidelines;
- The risk of bad debts - active credit control systems are maintained.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 30 June 2023.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS
The Directors are confident the business is operating the correct program of policies and continue to maintain contracts in all areas of operations. The external commercial environment, most notably in relation to recruitment, interest rate rises and inflationary rises in operational costs,and reduction in crop yield due to extreme weather events has resulted in challenging conditions for the year under review. The company feels it is well placed to overcome these challenges and generate good returns as demonstrated in prior years.",3522587.0,94,71285,Reduction in crop yield due to extreme weather events,Extreme Weather,Challenging operational conditions,,True,[],,PE16 6XQ,Chatteris,Eastern,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00840309/filing-history/MzQxNjQ4MDIyMmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-28

We draw attention to the disclosure both within the Report of the Directors and on page 17 within note 3 of the financial statements which indicates the company is reliant on its bank overdraft facility in order to meet its liabilities as they fall due following two poor years of trading arising from both the impact of inflation on the company's cost base, extreme weather events reducing crop yields and sharp rises to the company's cost of borrowing which have given rise to a financial loss for the year of £1,381,375 as shown on page 9.

The availability of employees continues to apply pressure to deliver product and service standards. Many European staff have returned home since Brexit and with the anti-social hours of hospitality, others have taken the opportunities of the current market to turn to vacancies in other business sectors.

Weather
Particularly adverse weather conditions can affect our business, however in the main, our courses and facilities remain open in poor weather when others are closed. We have built a very strong reputation for providing the finest playing surfaces all year round.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2023


The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 July 2023.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS
The Autumn season in 2022 was strong for all growers with temperatures generally above average with average levels of rainfall throughout, meaning that all winter crops became established in advance of the colder winter months. There were few frosts over winter and despite heavy rainfall in March, the Spring season also started strongly and continued through to a relatively dry and warm early harvest. For the growers that had harvest later, there was interruptions for rain but in general yield levels were good and commodity prices remained strong as a direct consequence of the on-going war between Russia and Ukraine.",6614287.0,45,152126,Unpredictable rainfall and harvest interruptions from heavy rain,Extreme Weather,,,True,[],,KW14 8XW,Thurso,Scotland,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/SC243067/filing-history/MzQxNjQyOTM1OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-28

The Directors are disappointed by the results shown for 2023. The impact of the inflationary increases and extreme weather has hit agribusiness hard, which together with the wider economic conditions has seen significant increases to the cost of borrowing resulting in the company being reliant on the support of other group companies to fund the increased borrowing costs.

It is normal to feel worried, fearful and angry in response - but harnessed properly, our emotions can also propel us to take determined action. In 2022 we designed and launched an interactive self-guided digital tool exploring emotional responses to climate change, informed by a co-design exercise with young people and insights from climate psychology, environmental science and narrative change theory. We are now exploring ways to take this model to other demographics by creating resources which can be used in different community settings. This year we also conducted a nationwide research project exploring the links between personal and planetary health through qualitative research on young people’s perceptions of sustainable food.
