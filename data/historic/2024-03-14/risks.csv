Group Strategic Report

The directors present their strategic report of the company and the group for the year ended 30 June 2023.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS
Turnover dropped from £25.7m in 2022 to £21.6m in 2023. The drop reflects careful risk management adopted by the Company during a turbulent world stage.

 Price risk
Recent global economic uncertainty, the energy transition and the war in Ukraine have introduced volatility into global energy prices. This volatility influences current and future demand for the Group’s services.
 Credit risk
The Group’s financial assets are trade debtors and bank balances. The Group manages its debtors through regular review and follow-up of outstanding balances. The Group reviews its working capital requirements to ensure that credit risks can be adequately managed.

Disappointingly the UK economy languishes at the bottom of those projections due to domestic pressures, such as the continued adverse fallout from BREXIT or the perceived mismanagement of monetary policy from the bank of England.
 Inflationary pressure is clearly retreating, and the anticipated loosening of monetary policy is well flagged in the UK Gilt market, although the tone from the MPC and the Governor of the Bank of England continues to be cautious.

Inflationary pressures began to ease, with global energy prices back at levels last seen prior to the invasion of Ukraine. In addition, effects from the rise in energy prices following the invasion are now normalizing, putting further downward pressure on inflation. Although there is concern that should the Houthis in the Red Sea not be brought under control, disruption to logistics could see a reversal back to inflation.
 Prices of other commodities as well as global food prices have also eased. However, domestic inflationary pressures remain relatively elevated, in particular in those economies with tighter labour markets.
 After two years of uncertainty and lockdowns that resulted in the largest drop in global GDP, the downgrades seen in 2023 seemed to pause with global growth estimated to be 3% for 2023 and falling to 2.7% in 2027, according to the OECD.
