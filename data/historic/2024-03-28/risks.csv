Review of the business
The economic outlook of 2023 looks similar to 2023 – uneasy and continued increases in costs. Following the trend set in 2022, the last 12 months has seen interest rates continue to rise and uncertainty continue to spread. The cost of borrowing and energy prices remained high, plus the additional conflicts in the east disrupting global trade routes contributed to a bleak macro economic outlook.
 The business has successfully managed these obstacles and has demonstrated its ability to be adept at adapting. The only exception being the labour market – vacancies remained hard to fill as the supply of labour for warehouse work remains low. Overall, the business has been in a solid position to capitalise on industry growth.

Future Developments
Geox UK management confirms a conservative approach that defines the forecast for FY2024 substantially in line with FY2023. This forecast is also based on the following assumptions about the future performance of the fiscal year:
 1) consumers’ behaviour allows the continuation of the careful discount management implemented so far in direct stores;
 2) no changes in consumers’ habits compared to current ones; and
 3) the complex geo-political situation in the markets relevant to the Group does not lead to significant deterioration from what was observed in 2023 and/or impacts of further significant devaluation of their currencies against the Euro.
 These performance forecasts are however, due to their nature, subject to significant uncertainties in terms of the geopolitical and cost inflation environment.

Fair review of the business
FY23 was a challenging year for retail. The cost-of-living crisis triggered by the Ukraine war in 2022, was exacerbated by UK fiscal instability in 2023. Reduced customer confidence led to a reduction in demand, while weak GBP drove up import costs. Year on year sales were also impacted by the end of Covid-boosted demand for fitness equipment and small domestic appliances. The impact of weak GBP in FY23 has been partly mitigated by strong product cost negotiations and lower freight rates.

 Given the recent EU legislation concerning imports from China, the directors remain positive for the future of copper. Precious metal prices are predicted to rise over the next 12 to 24 months.

Following a difficult 2022 growing and harvesting season, the 2023 harvesting season was also dramatically affected by the vagaries of the climate. Heavy rainfall and flooding during the harvesting season have meant that crops have either been lost or are of poor quality. This has had a detrimental effect on the free buy market.
It is likely that towards the end of the season, there will be a shortage of potatoes. Accordingly, the Company is exploring opportunities to import potato crops from the EU and from further afield.
Through successful marketing, the Company has acquired further business from an existing customer.

Fair review of the business
The market slowed down in the second half of our financial year as the increase in the cost of living impacted. We have seen interest rate increases and an increase in bills including energy costs. On top of which we saw an increase in the price of some electric vehicles and limited supply.
We pushed on with some new products namely salary sacrifice and also DriveElectric Plus (Business product aimed at helping businesses with ESG reporting and reducing their carbon footprint).
The lower sales resulted in a reduced gross profit of £4.1 million (£4.7 million prior year, as restated) and overall we made a loss for this financial year.",3846579.0,45,51668,Increase in energy costs and limited supply of electric vehicles,Climate Change,,,True,[],No countries mentioned explicitly in the risk description.,SL7 2DX,Marlow,South East,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02776514/filing-history/MzQxNjQzMzMzM2FkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-28

This approach captures emissions associated with the operation of buildings within the scope of the regulation, plus transport. This report covers UK operations only, as required by SECR for Non-Quoted Large Companies.

This report also includes emissions from transmission and distribution losses of electricity under Scope 3, which are voluntary reportable emissions. Their inclusion is considered best practice.

Reading Transport Limited is not listed on a stock exchange such as the London Stock Exchange, so is classified as a Non-Quoted Large Company for the purpose of regulatory compliance.

Emissions have been calculated using the 2022 conversion factors provided by Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. The reporting period is 4th April 2022 to 2nd April 2023.
