  Principal risks and uncertainties
 
Given the nature of the company's business, the principal business risks relate to the following:
• Supply chain 
• Energy price astronomical increase
• Uncertain geopolitical situation
• Qualified staff shortage
• Recession/Cost of living
• Inflation across the board.
Various factors above are linked to the wider Economy, the majority of impact is being felt at present, and  all indications are that it is not necessarily beneficial to the sector. For example , Inflation, Energy prices, supply  chain  ,  recruitment  and  retention  of  workers  and  the  influence  of  uncertainty  are decreasing 
consumer disposable income and  are all increasing demands on resources across the hospitality sector.

  Principal risks and uncertainties
 
Given the nature of the company's business, the principal business risks relate to the following:
• Supply chain 
• Energy price astronomical increase
• Uncertain geopolitical situation
• Qualified staff shortage
• Recession/Cost of living
• Inflation across the board.
Various factors above are linked to the wider Economy, the majority of impact is being felt at present, and  all indications are that it is not necessarily beneficial to the sector. For example , Inflation, Energy prices, supply  chain  ,  recruitment  and  retention  of  workers  and  the  influence  of  uncertainty  are decreasing

 Inflationary pressure is clearly retreating, and the anticipated loosening of monetary policy is well flagged in the UK Gilt market, although the tone from the MPC and the Governor of the Bank of England continues to be cautious.

Investment policy and performance
The Charity has established an investment policy with Mercer Investment Advisors (formerly Pavillion) that provides for a diversified portfolio with a primary objective of balancing long-term real investment returns and capital preservation. Selection of specific investment vehicles is done with the support of our investment advisors. We have operated an informal policy of paying out an absolute maximum of 60% of our investment income through any given year. This has stood us in good stead as investment markets have been buffeted both by Covid and the war in Ukraine.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The principal risks facing Old Mill Topco are as follows:

1 Economic risks, and in particular, the ongoing risk of rising interest rates and inflation. More recently, these
macro risks have been compounded by the increase in conflicts around the world, notably in Europe and the
Middle East. To help manage these risks, multi-year financial forecasts have been produced, with different
scenarios run for different levels of interest rates. We also maintain a strong balance sheet which gives us a
strong platform from which to trade through a recession.",304031.0,409,38780,"Increase in global conflicts, especially in Europe and the Middle East",Interstate Conflict,,True,"['Bahrain', 'Cyprus', 'Egypt', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Israel', 'Jordan', 'Kuwait', 'Lebanon', 'Oman', 'Palestine', 'Qatar', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Syria', 'Turkey', 'United Arab Emirates', 'Yemen']","The risk described is the increase in global conflicts, particularly in these countries which are part of the Middle East region.",BA20 1SH,Yeovil,South West,https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13639993/filing-history/MzQxNTc4NDEyNGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=xhtml&download=0,2024-03-22,Compounded macroeconomic risks such as rising interest rates and inflation,49.68991,-19.523592

The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) is having a disrupting effect on global markets, staffing, supply chains, and general business operations. Whilst the outbreak was initially focussed in China, it has spread across a significant number of countries worldwide.
As such, the Company should assess the nature and extent of risks and uncertainties arising from the coronavirus. In doing so, the Company should consider what disclosures should be included within the Strategic Report/Directors' Report, where relevant.
It is important to remember that the disclosures needed in the Strategic Report/Directors' Report are likely to change over time as new information comes to light.

Fair review of the business
The business entered the financial year with a strong order book, anticipating a year of growth, and had budgeted accordingly. Investments in our people, plant and machinery, health and safety, and infrastructure were maintained. There were no COVID-19 restrictions in place during the financial year however there has been some continued fallout, notably the reduced availability of labour. Protracted constraints will be a risk and a concern. Overall, the resulting outcomes are considered acceptable.

Current assets have risen by 17.3% principally due to the rise in cash at bank whilst trade debtors remain in line with previous years.

The aforementioned growth in current assets have been offset by a 21.6% climb in current liabilities.

Principle risks and uncertainties

The fallout from Covid and the effect of the Ukrainian war increased our lead times and raw material costs.

The increase in the cost of living has been a challenge.

However, the mitigating factors are the investments we made in our machinery, sustainability and staff with training.

Future developments

In the next twelve months, the company is expecting to grow its sales to £8.5m and diversify our brands portfolio and product offering.

In the longer term, the company plans to double its turnover in 3 years.

Geox UK management confirms a conservative approach that defines the forecast for FY2024 substantially in line with FY2023. This forecast is also based on the following assumptions about the future performance of the fiscal year:
 1) consumers’ behaviour allows the continuation of the careful discount management implemented so far in direct stores;
 2) no changes in consumers’ habits compared to current ones; and
 3) the complex geo-political situation in the markets relevant to the Group does not lead to significant deterioration from what was observed in 2023 and/or impacts of further significant devaluation of their currencies against the Euro.

While the overall market for copper should be buoyant as a result of the demand driven by the energy sector and battery manufacturers, it is more than likely that the Chinese market is being fed by the Russian market with reduced priced imports.
 Given the recent EU legislation concerning imports from China, the directors remain positive for the future of copper. Precious metal prices are predicted to rise over the next 12 to 24 months. Although current global economic uncertainties, including various wars and sanctions, make future market predictions difficult, the directors are confident that metal prices will rise from levels seen in the year and that trade will continue to be prosperous in the years ahead.

The marine industry is still our main focus but we are starting to see interest in the architecture sector, especially with our high quality oval tube forming and fabrication. Investment in both technology and skills are key, we will be investing in cutting edge technology in the next 12 months. There is still a skill shortage in the UK, we have our own apprenticeship program to train the skill we cannot find on the job market, we plan to take on 6 apprentices in the next 12 months.

Following a difficult 2022 growing and harvesting season, the 2023 harvesting season was also dramatically affected by the vagaries of the climate.

Globally, the continuing terrorist activity in the Red Sea impacts on the costs of freight from the Far East; although the Ukraine/Russia conflict has given rise to opportunities with our military clients.
Every year staff recruitment, and in particular the search for qualified, experience technical candidates becomes increasingly problematic. This makes staff retention a key part of our strategy, and we work hard to train, motivate and reward the existing team to maximise staff retention.

  The principle risks and uncertainties relate to the performance of the Company's subsidiaries which are summarised as follows:
The continued stagnation of the UK economy and an upcoming election year means trading conditions remain tough and somewhat unpredictable. Globally, the continuing terrorist activity in the Red Sea impacts on the costs of freight from the Far East; although the Ukraine/Russia conflict has given rise to opportunities with our military clients.
Every year staff recruitment, and in particular the search for qualified, experience technical candidates becomes increasingly problematic. This makes staff retention a key part of our strategy, and we work hard to train, motivate and reward the existing team to maximise staff retention.
Despite complex and difficult market conditions the Directors are clear on their strategy to keep Amplicon relevant and profitable.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As detailed within the review of business, the directors consider that the current economic climate is creating the greatest uncertainty and are currently investigating ways to lessen the impact of material price rises.

The recruitment of appropriately skilled personnel is also considered to be a current risk. Where recruitment of personnel from within the industry has proven difficult, the company have recruited personnel from other sectors where those individuals have easily transferrable skills in the expectation that this will reduce the necessary training required.

The major risks to which the charity might be exposed have been identified and steps taken to mitigate those risks. Such risks include the effect of extreme weather conditions on gate money or the possible effects of eventualities such as cancellation due to Covid-19, foot and mouth and other causes.

A key element in the management of financial risk is the setting up of a reserves policy and its regular review by the Board of Trustees.

While the broader economic implications of the situation in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, such as heightened energy prices, increased inflationary pressures, supply issues, and currency fluctuations, are acknowledged, it is important to note that there are no direct financial consequences for the business at this present time.

The war between Russia and Ukraine had made countries like the US looking to reduce their dependence on Russia, which contribute to more supply backdrop. Against that supply backdrop, uranium demand continued to grow this past year and is set to increase substantially moving forward.

The trend where uranium prices could continue in 2024 remains uncertain, the question is whether the commodity will continue to rise steadily or spike higher like it did in the last cycle. The uncertainty of Fed's policy on interest rate also makes the price forecast more difficult.

During the period under review the company focused on risk management and cautious operation, building its customer base by entering contracts for the purchase and sale of uranium.

Fair review of the business
The Group continued to trade throughout a year of rising interest rates and challenging world events and subsequent volatility.
 Earnings from investment advisory services which are derived from fund management fees relating to size of assets under management ('AUM') were lower than the previous year as the effects of one of our business wind-downs goes through the accounts.

  The 2022/23 financial year presented the construction industry with a number of extraordinary challenges.

Principal risks and uncertainties
  Our core business is the sourcing and supply of fresh produce. It's an extremely competitive and fast moving sector, especially when it comes to price, quality and availability, and of course we're always at the mercy of the weather which can seriously affect supply and demand.
How do we mitigate the risks? First of all by having talented people – we're proud to have really skilled, motivated individuals working throughout the Company. We're good at communicating too, constantly in touch with our customers on one side, and our suppliers on the other to make sure we deliver great quality produce on time and at the best possible price. And we've got a strong track record.

 We have seen a fall in demand for our product in FY24 and expect this trend to continue whilst mortgage rates remain high. Q1 2024 has seen an increase in sales enquiries and required production output, with signs of the market returning to near normal in Q2 2024.

Group Strategic Report
for the Year Ended 31 December 2023

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties for the company are related to activity levels in the UK construction sector, the continued uptake of modular and offsite construction, and the availability of labour and materials.

Market Risks
In advance of Brexit the company carried out a comprehensive review of its supply chain to understand and mitigate the potential risks that may occur in the period immediately following the UK exit from the EU.

This review proved useful in understanding areas of potential weakness in the supply chain which may have come under strain during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",3539468.0,297,51320,Russian invasion of Ukraine,Interstate Conflict,,True,"['Russia', 'Ukraine']","The specified risk is directly related to the 'Russian invasion of Ukraine'.

The surge in demand for hyper-efficient, lean, data centres continued to offer lucrative new business opportunities, as well as the growing need to ensure process facilities in the life science sector are fit for purpose. The uncertainty of energy supply in Europe and the transition from carbon intensive energy production towards nuclear and renewables in order to meet net zero targets, also offered BWT opportunities to design scalable processes and solutions that can be rolled out on existing plants to replace coal with small modular reactors.

The other newer risk is that of streaming of games, and subscription models both of which together would challenge the historic convention of games ownership.

Ukraine Conflict - Because of the currently ongoing conflict in Ukraine there may be a small impact to fees earned from selling to Ukraine and Russia in the next financial year. These are considered immaterial to the overall trading though.

Policies on financial risks such as currency exposure are set out in the financial notes later in the audited accounts.

Worldwide climate change presents an ongoing risk that can affect many of our Producers with extreme weather impacts such as severe frosts, wildfires and floods affecting both the quantity and quality of the grapes and vines that they use to create the fine wines that appear in our portfolio.
